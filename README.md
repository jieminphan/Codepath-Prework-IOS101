An app which I would like to build would be the ultimate social app. This app allows you to add your friends, message them, and share your moments with them. It will have a schedule sharing function as well, such that you will be able to see your friends' schedules and they can see yours. Another function I would like to add on would be the bill splitting function.

## Notes
Challenges while building the app: Xcode is new to me thus I had difficulties navigating around the app. I was also not too familiar with Swift. I managed to solve these issues by doing research and seeking support from my fellow peers.
